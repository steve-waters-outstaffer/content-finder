### Impact

#### ScottMadden’s assistance helped the client to:

- Host more than 400 events nationwide ​
- Schedule interviews with nearly 30,000 candidates in less than three minutes per candidate​
- Send more than 300,000 messages to candidates

## Challenge

A food service and facilities management organization faced challenges hiring 80,000 candidates a year. ScottMadden led an assessment of the talent acquisition (TA) organization and discovered low candidate conversion rates, non-efficient processes, and opportunities for enhanced candidate experience. Although there was significant web traffic to the organization’s “Careers” page, the 1.2 million unique visits translated to only 220 applications.

## Process

- Gained a deep understanding of the client’s processes, metrics, business model, and demands
- Gathered requirements from the TA customers—hiring managers, TA subject matter experts, and HR technology administrators and owners
- Developed requirements that focused on specific functionality that resolved the identified challenges and aligned with the organization’s HR technology roadmap
- Identified solutions that were experimental and scalable with low implementation efforts that could quickly yield a high value
- Facilitated a comprehensive vendor selection process, from issuing the request for proposal through final vendor selection, due diligence, and implementation planning

## Result

- Selected Paradox, a leading conversational AI recruiting software, which met and exceeded the functional requirements and the client’s expectations
- Collaborated to develop a roadmap to expand the use cases and scale adoption of the new technology across the enterprise
- To date, the organization has hosted more than 400 events nationwide and has scheduled interviews with nearly 30,000 candidates in less than three minutes per candidate
