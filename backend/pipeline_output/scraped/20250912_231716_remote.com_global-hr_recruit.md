## Frequently asked questions

How does Recruit help me find candidates?

With Recruit, you don’t just post a job and wait—you can instantly search for and reach out to top candidate matches. Our AI-powered sourcing and match tools help you easily find the right talent based on skills, experience, and salary fit, so you can hire with confidence.

How does AI Matches work?

AI Matches instantly surfaces top candidates based on your job criteria. It analyzes skills, experience, location, workplace preferences, and salary expectations to match you with the best-fit talent—without the manual search.

Are AI Matches and Sourcing the same?

No — AI Matches surfaces candidates who have actively created profiles on our job board. These are pre-vetted candidates who have opted in and are looking for roles. Sourcing allows you to proactively search a global database of 800 million profiles. This expands your reach beyond active job seekers to discover talent worldwide.

Can I source candidates globally with Recruit?

Yes! Recruit gives you access to 800 million profiles worldwide, and we’re continuously adding region-specific talent pools to help you find the right remote talent anywhere.

Can job postings be geo-specific?

Yes! Geo-targeting is built in—you can specify locations, regions, or flexible setups like “Remote in the US only.”

How does Recruit use AI?

Recruit’s AI helps you find talent faster while keeping you in control. We leverage AI in our Sourcing, Matching, and Job posting features to suggest top candidate matches and simplify searches with natural language, but you make the final decisions. AI assists your hiring process—it doesn’t replace human judgment.

How does Recruit promote our job postings to attract candidates?

We don’t sponsor or boost postings like other job boards, which often leads to clutter. Instead, we prioritize quality over quantity, ensuring your job reaches high-intent candidates who are actively searching for roles like yours.

Can I export candidate profiles?

Yes, candidate profile exports are completely free.

How does Recruit work with my ATS?

Recruit comes with its own built-in mini ATS and integrates with Greenhouse for seamless job postings.

Can I invite my team to use Recruit with me?

Yes! Every plan includes unlimited user seats, so your entire team can collaborate.

Do you take a percentage of compensation or charge placement fees if I hire someone?

Nope! We don’t take a cut of compensation or charge placement fees—just a simple, predictable subscription so you can hire without worrying about hidden costs or surprises.
