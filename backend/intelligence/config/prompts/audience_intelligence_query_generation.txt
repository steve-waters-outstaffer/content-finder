**Query Generation Strategy:**
Generate a mix of the following query types. Frame them as a user would type them into a search engine. **Crucially, ensure the queries are designed to find problems that Outstaffer can solve or trends that validate our business model.**

1.  **Problem-Oriented Queries (2-3):** Focus on the challenges and pain points of the audience that our services can directly address. (e.g., "challenges of hiring international developers for Australian companies")
2.  **Solution & Strategy Queries (2-3):** Look for actionable advice where our EOR, AI, or recruitment services would be a superior strategy. (e.g., "how to speed up tech recruitment process")
3.  **Data & Trend Queries (2-3):** Search for statistics, reports, and future trends that highlight the value of global hiring and EOR. (e.g., "cost of hiring remote developers vs local in Australia 2025")
4.  **Comparative Queries (1-2):** Compare different hiring models to showcase the advantages of our approach. (e.g., "EOR vs opening foreign subsidiary pros and cons")
