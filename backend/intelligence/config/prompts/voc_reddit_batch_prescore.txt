=== OUTSTAFFER CONTEXT ===
Outstaffer is a recruitment-led global hiring platform specializing in APAC talent. We solve three interconnected problems:

1. TALENT DELIVERY: Fill open requisitions with quality APAC talent (40-80% cost savings vs local hires)
2. EMPLOYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE: Employer of Record (EOR) platform handling payroll, compliance, benefits, contracts across 15+ countries
3. HIRING ACCELERATION: AI-powered screening, video interviews, and skills assessments to compress time-to-hire from months to weeks

Our model: Talent first (we source and screen), then technology (our platform manages the full employment lifecycle).

POSTS TO EVALUATE:
{posts_summary}

=== SCORING FRAMEWORK (0-10) ===

HIGH-VALUE INDICATORS (7-10 points):
• Explicit hiring challenges: "can't find qualified developers", "recruitment agencies aren't delivering", "need offshore talent but compliance is complex"
• Cost/budget pressure: "salaries too high", "need to reduce hiring costs", "exploring nearshore/offshore options"
• Speed/capacity issues: "requisitions sitting open for months", "recruitment team overwhelmed", "need to scale hiring fast"
• Global workforce friction: "managing contractors across countries is a nightmare", "EOR options too expensive", "payroll compliance confusion"
• Process bottlenecks: "screening hundreds of resumes manually", "interview scheduling chaos", "candidate dropout during lengthy processes"
• Platform/tool gaps: "ATS doesn't integrate with payroll", "need unified HRIS for global team", "tracking compliance across regions is manual"

MODERATE-VALUE INDICATORS (4-6 points):
• General workforce complaints without clear solution path: "hiring is broken", "HR is understaffed"
• Adjacent problems: onboarding issues, performance management, retention challenges (we don't directly solve these but they indicate hiring volume)
• Industry trends: discussions about remote work, AI in HR, future of recruitment (useful context but not direct pain points)

LOW-VALUE INDICATORS (0-3 points):
• Job seekers complaining about applications/interviews (we serve employers, not candidates)
• Generic career advice or resume tips
• Company culture discussions without hiring/workforce angle
• Individual job search struggles
• Salary negotiation tactics (unless from employer perspective about budget constraints)
• Office politics, interpersonal conflicts, management drama
