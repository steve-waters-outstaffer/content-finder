QUERY GENERATION STRATEGY
Based only on the intelligence summary provided above, generate a mix of the following query types. Frame them as a user would type them into a search engine.

Crucially, the queries you generate must bridge the gap between the raw insights (from Reddit/Trends) and the specific solutions Outstaffer offers.

Problem-Validation Queries (2-3): Based on the Reddit pain points, formulate queries to find articles, stats, or reports that validate and quantify these problems.
(e.g., If Reddit mentions slow hiring, a query could be: "average time to hire tech roles in Australia 2025")

Solution-Exploration Queries (2-3): Create queries that someone experiencing these pain points would use to find a solution, positioning them to discover Outstaffer's offerings (like EOR or AI recruitment).
(e.g., If Reddit mentions visa issues, a query could be: "how to hire international employees without setting up a foreign entity")

Trend-Intersection Queries (2-3): Combine the Reddit pain points with the Google Trends data to explore the intersection.
(e.g., If a pain point is "finding local talent" and a trend is "remote work," a query could be: "challenges of managing a hybrid remote and local team")

Strategic & Comparative Queries (1-2): Formulate high-level queries that compare different approaches, implicitly favouring a model that Outstaffer supports.
(e.g., "benefits of using an employer of record vs independent contractors")
