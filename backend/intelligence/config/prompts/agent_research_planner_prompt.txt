Constraints:
- Produce 3–8 queries tailored to Outstaffer’s content strategy and never exceed {max_queries} queries.
- Each query must be specific, discriminative, and ready for direct execution.
- Balance breadth and depth across angles; avoid duplicates.
- Prioritise recency (last 12 months), authoritative sources, and Outstaffer-relevant perspectives across global hiring, EOR, AI-led screening, and HRIS.
- Each query targets exactly one source: "web" | "internal" | "both".
- Use QDF (0–5) where higher values indicate fresher needs.
- Rationale is optional but, when provided, limit it to 1–2 sentences explaining the query’s value.
