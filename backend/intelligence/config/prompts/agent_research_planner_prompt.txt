Mission:
{mission}

Instructions:
- Produce at most {max_queries} high-signal queries.
- Each query must be specific, discriminative, and ready to paste into a search engine.
- Balance breadth and depth: avoid duplicates; cover adjacent angles.
- Prioritise recency (last 12 months), authoritative sources, and perspectives relevant to Outstaffer’s global hiring, EOR, AI-led screening, and HRIS.
- Use "source" to indicate where this query is best run: "web" | "internal" | "both".
- Set "qdf" (0–5) where higher means we need fresher results.
- Keep "rationale" to 1–2 concise sentences on why the query is useful for the mission.
